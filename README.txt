This project was closed some time ago for the birth of a new and better solution: validaform3 (https://github.com/rcdmk/validaform3)
It may saund strange, but this is the second version and the changes where so big that I
decided to make a new repo, since I've started again from the groud up.


This is a old project somewhat reinventing the weel to use in any web
project for client-side javascript validation of form data.
